                At the tender age of 6, I twirled in a vibrant green skirt. At 7, the hue transformed into a delicate light blue, and at 8, I gracefully donned a rich, dark brown. The rhythmic tap of my knock-off Nike shoes echoed on the cement as I found myself engulfed in a new environment, a new country, at the age of 10. The seventh school I’d attended by then. This particular year proved to be the most challenging, yet enlightening, expanding my awareness of the world. With a mere six classmates in my grade, I soared academically, without diminishing my efforts. My diligence was etched into the school, a testament to my unwavering commitment to excellence.

                Now 12 years later, having navigated through a total of 12 schools, I have chosen Brigham Young University to be my thirteenth choice. One I believe would propel me to greater heights. Brigham Young said, “Every intelligent being on the Earth is tempered for glory, beauty, excellency, and knowledge here, and for immortality and eternal lives in the worlds to come." I value this time of my life and realize the opportunities that have been placed on my path.

                My whole high school journey I focused on Tourism as I expected my future career to be. The pandemic happened and I saw an introductory web development course. It was new to me. I had never heard of such concepts. My world changed, and after waiting 4 years after high school graduation, I finally had the chance to apply to a University. I chose Computer Science as my degree to study at Brigham Young University. Embarking on a new journey, a completely different set of learning than what I had anticipated. With my personal journey in learning, I have acquired both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. Through the years of growth, I have become my own individual. I know what I like and don't like. I know what I am passionate about and what I am not passionate about. I am taking a step into my journey of not being a passive but an active learner.

                I am adding a new skirt to my wardrobe. A garment woven with threads of curiosity, resilience, and new discoveries in the realm of Computer Science.
