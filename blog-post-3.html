                ‘"Isang kahig, isang tuka" or "one scratch, one peck" is a Filipino saying portraying poverty. A chicken scratches the dirt to eat one worm at a time, meaning people only get to eat as they earn. Our thinking can quickly create this scarcity mindset. When I get past temporal substance, is when I transcend to a greater understanding of how one can survive and achieve more in this life, where it is nor the beginning nor the end. I learned to improve my learning capabilities where I won't be burdened by the scarcity of knowledge in my day-to-day life.

            </p>
            <p>I was raised to be studious and to value knowledge. From a young age, it was a habit in our household to be organized and have time to study, both for secular and spiritual learning. I graduated high school in Australia at 17 and I saw my batchmates in the Philippines halfway through college (Due to the school system then in the Philippines). I entered a period of my life where I felt poor because I was not having the same opportunity as them. At 17 years of age, I had to get through the scarcity mentality. I was just getting through the day as the day went on but not to the extent of progression that I could attain. I served a full time mission for the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it was a huge blessing in my life. I returned at the age of 20, and my batchmates have graduated college. I finally learned that this is not relevant to learning and progression. These are just different timelines of different people. I knew then and there that the years I had experienced gave me the learnings I needed that I couldn't obtain any other way. I felt so rich in knowledge, wealthy in hope and faith. I rose from the poverty caused by my mentality.”

            Today, I see that I am capable of more than I can imagine. I am proud to have been inducted into Phi Kappa Phi. I felt honoured to be accepting an award for my academic excellence. I am part of the 1300 students, faculty, staff, and alumni all around the world. This is the greatest assurance to my perseverance and motivation to continue learning.
